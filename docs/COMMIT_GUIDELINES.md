# Commit Message Guidelines

This document outlines the recommended format for commit messages in this project. Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure that the history of the codebase is clear, concise, and easy to understand.

## Format

Each commit message should be structured as follows:

`<type>-<app/service>: <message>`


Where:

- `<type>` indicates the type of change being made.
- `<app/service>` is the name of the app or service that the change is related to.
- `<message>` provides a brief description of the change.

## Types

The following types are recommended for use in this project:

- `feat`: for new features or improvements
- `fix`: for bug fixes
- `docs`: for documentation updates
- `style`: for code style changes (e.g. formatting, indentation)
- `refactor`: for code refactoring (i.e. changes that do not add new features or fix bugs)
- `test`: for changes to tests or test infrastructure
- `chore`: for other changes that do not affect the application logic (e.g. build scripts, dependencies)

## Message

The message should be written in the present tense, and should concisely describe the change being made. Avoid using technical terms that may not be understood by others who are unfamiliar with the codebase.

Here are a few examples of good commit messages:

```
feat-ui: Add new user profile page
fix-auth: Resolve authentication issue
docs-data: Update Data service documentation
```

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that the commit history of this project is clear, concise, and easy to understand. This will make it easier for other developers to understand the changes you have made and why, and will help maintain the quality of the codebase over time.
